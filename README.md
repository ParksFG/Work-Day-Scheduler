# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This project was developed to work on JavaScript and Third Party APIs.  It is a simple work day scheduler that accurately tracks the day and time.  Currently there is no functionality for going back to previous days, but a simple scheduler for singular days.  This project was mainly a documentation reading project to checkout how well I can incorparate APIs.
